## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external tools, data sources, and services. In IllumiChat, MCP integrations allow your AI assistants to access real-time information from your existing systems and workflows.

## How MCP Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Assistant receives user query">
  A user asks a question that requires external data or action.
</Step>

<Step title="Assistant identifies need for MCP">
  The assistant determines that it needs to access external information or perform an action.
</Step>

<Step title="MCP connection established">
  The assistant securely connects to the configured MCP server.
</Step>

<Step title="Data retrieved or action performed">
  The MCP server fetches the required data or executes the requested action.
</Step>

<Step title="Response generated">
  The assistant incorporates the external data into its response to the user.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up MCP Integrations

### Prerequisites

Before setting up MCP integrations, ensure you have:

- An active IllumiChat account
- Access to the external system you want to integrate
- Appropriate permissions and API credentials
- Understanding of the data you want to access

### Configuration Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Integration">
  Select the MCP integration you want to configure from the integrations menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Provide Credentials">
  Enter the necessary authentication credentials and connection details.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Permissions">
  Set up what data and actions your assistant can access.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Connection">
  Verify that the integration is working correctly with test queries.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Assistant">

</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- **API Keys**: Secure storage and rotation of credentials
- **OAuth Flows**: Use OAuth 2.0 for enhanced security
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and validation

### Data Privacy

- **Selective Access**: Only request necessary data
- **Data Minimization**: Limit data retention and usage
- **User Consent**: Respect user privacy preferences

### Access Control

- **Role-Based Permissions**: Different access levels for different users
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure system stability
