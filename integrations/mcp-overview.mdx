## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external tools, data sources, and services. In IllumiChat, MCP integrations allow your AI assistants to access real-time information from your existing systems and workflows.

## How MCP Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Assistant receives user query">
  A user asks a question that requires external data or action.
</Step>

<Step title="Assistant identifies need for MCP">
  The assistant determines that it needs to access external information or perform an action.
</Step>

<Step title="MCP connection established">
  The assistant securely connects to the configured MCP server.
</Step>

<Step title="Data retrieved or action performed">
  The MCP server fetches the required data or executes the requested action.
</Step>

<Step title="Response generated">
  The assistant incorporates the external data into its response to the user.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits of MCP Integrations

### Real-Time Data Access

## Setting Up MCP Integrations

### Prerequisites

Before setting up MCP integrations, ensure you have:

- An active IllumiChat account
- Access to the external system you want to integrate
- Appropriate permissions and API credentials
- Understanding of the data you want to access

### Configuration Process

#### Method 1: Connect via Assistant Configuration

<Steps>
<Step title="Access MCP Settings">
  Navigate to your assistant's edit page and click on the "Tools" tab to find the MCP integration section.

  <Info>
  **Important**: You cannot connect MCP tools to the default "IllumiChat" assistant. Make sure you're configuring a custom assistant.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate Connection">
  Click "Connect" next to the desired service (e.g., Jira). This will open the OAuth authorization modal.

</Step>

<Step title="Authorize Access">
  Select your account from the dropdown menu and click "Accept" to grant the necessary permissions.
  
  ![Jira OAuth Accept](/images/mcp-assistant-screenshots/jira-oauth-accept.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Success">
  Verify that the connection was established successfully. You should see a confirmation message.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Permissions">
  Set up what data and actions your assistant can access in the connected system.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Method 2: Connect via Workspace

You can also connect MCP tools directly from the workspace:

1. Open your workspace
2. Click the "+" button
3. Select "Connect MCP Tools"
4. Follow the same connection process as above

<Tip>
Connecting via workspace is convenient when you're already working with your data and want to add new integrations on the fly. Just make sure you're on the correct assistant - you cannot connect MCP tools to the default IllumiChat assistant.
</Tip>

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- **API Keys**: Secure storage and rotation of credentials
- **OAuth Flows**: Use OAuth 2.0 for enhanced security
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and validation

### Data Privacy

- **Selective Access**: Only request necessary data
- **Data Minimization**: Limit data retention and usage
- **User Consent**: Respect user privacy preferences

### Access Control

- **Role-Based Permissions**: Different access levels for different users
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure system stability

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

<Info>
Begin with simple data retrieval before adding complex actions and workflows.
</Info>

### 2. Test Thoroughly

- Test with various user scenarios
- Verify data accuracy and timeliness
- Check error handling and fallbacks
- Monitor performance impact

### 3. Document Integration

- Document what data is accessed
- Explain how the integration works
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Keep documentation updated

### 4. Monitor Usage

- Track integration performance
- Monitor error rates and response times
- Analyze usage patterns
- Optimize based on insights
