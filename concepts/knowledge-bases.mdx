## What are Knowledge Bases?

Knowledge bases are organized collections of information that give your AI assistant the expertise it needs to answer questions accurately and helpfully. Think of them as the "brain" of your assistant - the more comprehensive and well-organized your knowledge base, the smarter your assistant becomes.

## How Knowledge Bases Work

### Information Storage

Your knowledge base stores information in multiple formats:

- **Documents**: PDFs, Word documents, text files
- **Web Content**: Crawled websites and online resources
- **Custom Entries**: Manually created knowledge snippets
- **Structured Data**: Organized information for easy retrieval

### Intelligent Search

When a user asks a question, your assistant:

1. **Analyzes the query** to understand what information is needed
2. **Searches the knowledge base** for relevant content
3. **Retrieves the best matches** based on relevance and accuracy
4. **Uses the information** to generate a helpful response

<Tip>
The quality of your assistant's responses directly depends on the quality and organization of your knowledge base.
</Tip>

## Types of Knowledge Content

### Document Uploads

Upload existing documentation and content:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Supported Formats
PDF files (.pdf)
Word documents (.docx)
Text files (.txt)
Markdown files (.md)
```

```bash File Size Limits
Individual files: Up to 10MB
Total storage: Varies by plan
```
</CodeGroup>

### Web Content Crawling

Add online resources to your knowledge base:

- **Website URLs**: Crawl entire websites or specific pages
- **Blog Posts**: Include articles and blog content
- **Documentation Sites**: Add technical documentation
- **Knowledge Articles**: Include help center content

<Warning>
Only crawl websites you own or have permission to use. Respect robots.txt and rate limits.
</Warning>

### Custom Knowledge Entries

Create specific knowledge snippets:

- **FAQ Entries**: Common questions and answers
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Definitions**: Important terms and concepts
- **Examples**: Real-world use cases and scenarios

## Organizing Your Knowledge Base

### Categories and Tags

Organize your content for better retrieval:

- **Categories**: Group related content (e.g., "Product Features", "Troubleshooting")
- **Tags**: Add specific labels for easy searching
- **Hierarchy**: Create logical content structures

### Content Prioritization

Not all content is equally important:

- **Primary Sources**: Most authoritative and up-to-date information
- **Secondary Sources**: Supporting documentation and examples
- **Reference Material**: Background information and context

## Best Practices for Knowledge Bases

### 1. Quality Over Quantity

<Info>
It's better to have 100 high-quality, accurate documents than 1000 outdated or incorrect ones.
</Info>

- Ensure information is accurate and current
- Remove outdated or incorrect content
- Regular reviews and updates
- Fact-check important information

### 2. Clear Organization

- Use descriptive file names
- Organize content logically
- Add appropriate tags and categories
- Create clear content hierarchies

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage

- Cover all common use cases
- Include troubleshooting information
- Provide examples and context
- Address edge cases and limitations

### 4. Regular Maintenance

- Schedule regular content reviews
- Update information as needed
- Remove obsolete content
- Monitor usage and effectiveness

## Knowledge Base Analytics

Track how your knowledge base is performing:

- **Most Used Content**: See what information is accessed most
- **Search Patterns**: Understand what users are looking for
- **Gaps**: Identify missing information
- **Effectiveness**: Measure response quality and user satisfaction

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

- All content is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access controls and permissions
- Audit logs for content access
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### Content Ownership

- You retain full ownership of your content
- Easy export and backup options
- Complete deletion capabilities
- No training on your proprietary data
