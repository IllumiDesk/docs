## What are AI Assistants?

AI assistants are intelligent conversational agents that can understand user queries, access relevant information, and provide helpful responses. In IllumiChat, AI assistants combine the power of large language models with your custom knowledge base to create specialized, domain-specific helpers.

## Key Components of an AI Assistant

### Personality & Behavior

Your assistant's personality determines how it communicates with users:

- **Tone**: Professional, friendly, casual, or formal
- **Style**: Conversational, direct, or detailed
- **Expertise**: Domain-specific knowledge and capabilities
- **Limitations**: What the assistant can and cannot do

<Example>
**Professional Assistant**: "I can help you with technical support questions. Please provide your account details so I can assist you effectively."

**Friendly Assistant**: "Hey there! I'm here to help with any questions you might have. What can I do for you today?"
</Example>

### Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is the foundation of your assistant's expertise:

- **Documents**: PDFs, Word docs, text files
- **Web Content**: Crawled websites and online resources
- **Custom Entries**: Manually created knowledge snippets
- **Structured Data**: Organized information for easy retrieval

<Tip>
A well-organized knowledge base with clear, accurate information will make your assistant much more effective.
</Tip>

### Integrations

MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations extend your assistant's capabilities:

- **HubSpot**: Access customer data and CRM information
- **Jira**: Retrieve project and ticket information
- **Custom APIs**: Connect to your own systems and data sources
