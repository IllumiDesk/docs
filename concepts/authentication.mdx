## Authentication Overview

IllumiChat provides multiple authentication methods to secure your account and API access. Understanding these options helps you choose the right approach for your use case.

## Account Authentication

### Email/Password Authentication

The standard authentication method for web access:

- **Sign Up**: Create account with email and password
- **Sign In**: Access your dashboard and manage assistants
- **Password Reset**: Secure password recovery process
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layer (optional)

<Tip>
Use a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication for enhanced security.
</Tip>

### Social Authentication

Connect your account using existing credentials:

- **Google**: Sign in with Google account
- **GitHub**: Use GitHub credentials
- **Microsoft**: Connect with Microsoft account

<Info>
Social authentication provides convenience while maintaining security through OAuth protocols.
</Info>

## API Authentication

### API Keys

Use API keys for programmatic access to IllumiChat services:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.illumichat.com/v1/assistants' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Assistant",
    "description": "A helpful AI assistant"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json Success
{
  "id": "asst_123456789",
  "name": "My Assistant",
  "description": "A helpful AI assistant",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "active"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

### API Key Management

- **Create Keys**: Generate new API keys from your dashboard
- **Key Permissions**: Set specific permissions for each key
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly update keys for security
- **Key Revocation**: Immediately disable compromised keys

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Security Features

### Data Encryption

All data is protected with industry-standard encryption:

- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data

- **File Uploads**: Encrypted storage for all uploaded content

### Access Controls

Granular permissions and access management:

- **User Roles**: Admin, Editor, Viewer permissions
- **Workspace Access**: Control who can access your assistants
- **API Scopes**: Limit API key permissions
- **Audit Logs**: Track all access and changes

### Privacy Protection

Your data remains private and secure:

- **No Training**: We never use your content to train our models
- **Data Ownership**: You retain full ownership of your data
- **Data Deletion**: Complete data removal on request
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 compliance
