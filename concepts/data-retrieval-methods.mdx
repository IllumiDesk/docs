## Data Retrieval Methods

IllumiChat provides two different ways for your AI assistant to access information: **Knowledge Base Retrieval** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools**. Understanding the differences between these methods is crucial for choosing the right approach for your use case.

## Knowledge Base Retrieval

### How It Works

Knowledge base retrieval allows your assistant to access information you've uploaded and organized:

- **Uploaded Content**: Documents, text files, web content you've crawled
- **Stored Information**: All content is processed and stored in your knowledge base
- **Context Search**: Assistant searches through your knowledge base to find relevant information
- **Response Generation**: Uses found information to generate helpful responses

### Access and Privacy

<Warning>
**Important**: Knowledge base content is accessible to anyone who has access to your assistant or chat embed.
</Warning>

#### Public Accessibility

- **Chat Widget**: Anyone using your embedded chat can access knowledge base content
- **Public Sharing**: If you share your assistant publicly, all users can access the knowledge base
- **Team Access**: If you share with team members, they can access all knowledge base content

#### Use Cases

Knowledge bases are ideal for:

- **Public Information**: Product documentation, FAQs, help articles
- **Team Knowledge**: Company policies, procedures, shared resources
- **Customer Support**: Information you want customers to access
- **Public Assistants**: Content you're comfortable sharing with everyone

<Example>
**Customer Support Assistant**: Upload product manuals, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides. Customers can ask questions and get answers based on this public information.
</Example>

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools

### How It Works

MCP tools provide real-time access to external systems and data sources:

- **Live Connections**: Direct connection to your Jira, HubSpot, or other systems
- **Real-Time Data**: Access current, up-to-date information from your tools
- **User-Specific**: Connections are tied to your account and credentials
- **Dynamic Queries**: Assistant can query your systems in real-time

### Access and Privacy

<Info>
**Secure**: MCP tools are assistant and user-specific. Only you can access your connected accounts.
</Info>

#### Private Access

- **Personal Use**: MCP connections are for your personal workspace use
- **Account-Specific**: Your HubSpot/Jira credentials are not shared with others
- **Workspace Only**: Primarily used in the private workspace environment
- **No Public Access**: Other users cannot access your MCP-connected data

#### Use Cases

MCP tools are ideal for:

- **Personal Analysis**: Querying your own data for insights
- **Document Creation**: Using your data to generate reports and documents
- **Research**: Analyzing information from your business systems
- **Private Workspace**: Personal ChatGPT-like experience with your data

<Example>
**Personal Workspace**: Connect your HubSpot account to analyze customer data, create reports, or answer questions about your business metrics without sharing access with others.
</Example>

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Knowledge Base | MCP Tools |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Data Source** | Uploaded/stored content | Live external systems |
| **Access Control** | Public to assistant users | Private to you only |
| **Data Freshness** | Static (until updated) | Real-time |
| **Use Case** | Public information sharing | Private data analysis |
| **Setup** | Upload and organize content | Connect external accounts |
| **Sharing** | Available to all assistant users | Personal workspace only |

## Choosing the Right Method

### Use Knowledge Base When:

✅ You want to share information publicly  
✅ Content is meant for customer/team access  
✅ Information is relatively static  
✅ You're comfortable with public accessibility  
✅ Building customer-facing assistants  

### Use MCP Tools When:

✅ You need real-time data from your systems  
✅ Information is private and personal  
✅ You want to analyze your own business data  
✅ Working in your private workspace  
✅ Creating personal documents and reports  

## Security Considerations

### Knowledge Base Security

- **Content Review**: Only upload content you're comfortable sharing publicly
- **Access Control**: Be mindful of who has access to your assistant
- **Regular Updates**: Keep content current and accurate
- **Sensitive Information**: Never upload confidential or private data

### MCP Security

- **Credential Protection**: Your account credentials remain secure
- **Private Access**: Only you can access your connected systems
- **Workspace Only**: MCP tools are primarily for personal workspace use
- **Account Management**: You control which systems to connect

## Best Practices

### 1. Plan Your Data Strategy

- Identify what information should be public vs. private
- Determine which data needs real-time access
- Consider your audience and their needs

### 2. Organize Knowledge Base Content

- Structure content logically for easy retrieval
- Use clear, descriptive titles and tags
- Regular maintenance and updates

### 3. Use MCP Tools Strategically

- Connect only the systems you need
- Use for personal analysis and document creation
- Keep credentials secure and up-to-date

### 4. Monitor and Maintain

- Regularly review knowledge base content
- Update outdated information
- Monitor MCP connection performance
