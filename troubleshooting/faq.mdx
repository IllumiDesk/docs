## General Questions

### What is IllumiChat?

IllumiChat is an AI assistant builder platform that allows you to create intelligent conversational agents with your own knowledge base. You can upload documents, integrate with external tools via MCP, and deploy assistants across multiple platforms.

### How much does IllumiChat cost?

We offer a free tier to get started, with paid plans starting at $49/month for advanced features and higher usage limits. See our [pricing page](/pricing) for detailed plan information.

### Is my data secure?

Yes, we take security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, we never use your content to train our models, and you retain full ownership of your data. We're compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2.

## AI Assistants

### How do AI assistants work?

AI assistants combine large language models with your custom knowledge base to provide intelligent responses. When a user asks a question, the assistant searches your knowledge base for relevant information and generates a helpful response.

### What types of content can I upload?

We support PDF files, Word documents (.docx), text files (.txt), and Markdown files (.md). You can also crawl website content and create custom knowledge entries.

### How accurate are the responses?

Response accuracy depends on the quality and relevance of your knowledge base. The more comprehensive and well-organized your content, the better your assistant will perform. We recommend regular testing and content updates.

### Can I customize my assistant's personality?

Yes! You can configure the tone (professional, friendly, casual, formal), style (helpful, direct, detailed, concise), and expertise level of your assistant to match your brand and use case.

## Knowledge Bases

### How much content can I upload?

File size limits vary by plan. Individual files can be up to 10MB, and total storage depends on your subscription tier. Contact us if you need higher limits.

### Can I organize my content?

Yes, you can organize content using categories, tags, and hierarchies. This helps your assistant find the most relevant information quickly and provides better responses.

### How often should I update my knowledge base?

We recommend regular updates to keep information current and accurate. Many users update weekly or monthly, depending on how frequently their content changes.

### Can I export my knowledge base?

Yes, you can export your knowledge base content at any time. We provide easy export options to ensure you always have access to your data.

## Integrations

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external tools and data sources. It enables real-time access to information from your existing systems.

### Which MCP integrations do you support?

Each integration has its own setup guide. See our [MCP overview](/integrations/mcp-overview) and specific setup guides for [HubSpot](/integrations/mcp-hubspot-setup) and [Jira](/integrations/mcp-jira-setup).

### Can I integrate with my own systems?

Yes, you can build custom MCP servers to connect to your internal systems, proprietary data sources, or custom APIs. See our [custom MCP guide](/integrations/custom-mcp) for details.
