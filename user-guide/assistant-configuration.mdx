## Assistant Configuration

Configure your AI assistant's core functionality through the Configuration, Knowledge Base, and Tools tabs.

## Configuration Tab

### Model Selection

Choose the AI model that powers your assistant:

<ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
Select the AI model for your assistant. Available models:
- OpenAI GPT-4o
- OpenAI GPT-4.1
- OpenAI GPT-5
- OpenAI GPT-o3
- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
</ParamField>

<Tip>
Different models have different strengths. GPT-4o is great for general use, while GPT-5 excels at complex reasoning tasks.
</Tip>

### Strict Mode

Control how your assistant uses knowledge base information:

<ParamField body="strict_mode" type="boolean" default="false">
When enabled, the assistant will only respond using information from the connected knowledge base.
</ParamField>

<Info>
**Strict Mode Options:**
- **Enabled**: Assistant only uses knowledge base information (more accurate but limited)
- **Disabled**: Assistant can use both knowledge base and general knowledge (more flexible)

This option only appears after you've connected a knowledge base and it has synced data.
</Info>

### Trigger Keywords

Set up automatic knowledge base lookups:

<ParamField body="trigger_keywords" type="array">
Add words or phrases that, in normal mode, will automatically trigger a knowledge base lookup.
</ParamField>

<Warning>
Trigger keywords only work when Strict Mode is disabled. Connect a knowledge base with synced data to access this feature.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use trigger keywords for domain-specific terms, product names, technical jargon, or any words that should always prompt a knowledge base search.
</Tip>

### Instructions

Define your assistant's behavior and personality:

<ParamField body="instructions" type="text">
Define your assistant's role, operating guidelines, and response style. You can use templates or write custom instructions (optional).
</ParamField>

<Example>
**Standard AI Assistant Template**:
- Role Definition: Responsive, intelligent AI assistant
- Operating Guidelines: Respect boundaries, stay in scope, honor knowledge constraints
- Positive Closures: End with supportive closing remarks
</Example>

## Knowledge Base Tab

Manage the knowledge base connected to this assistant. Knowledge bases provide context and information that help your assistant give more accurate responses.

### Getting Started with Knowledge Bases

When you first access the Knowledge Base tab, you'll see:

![No Knowledge Base Connected](/images/kb-screenshots/no-knowledge-base.png)

This shows that no knowledge base is currently connected to your assistant.

### Creating Your First Knowledge Base

Click the "Create Knowledge Base" button to get started:

![Create Knowledge Base](/images/kb-screenshots/create-knowledge-base.png)

This will create a new knowledge base specifically for this assistant and automatically connect it.

### Selecting an Existing Knowledge Base

If you already have knowledge bases, you can select from existing ones:

![Select Knowledge Base](/images/kb-screenshots/select-knowledge-base.png)

Choose the knowledge base that best fits your assistant's purpose.

### Knowledge Base Connected

Once connected, you'll see the knowledge base management interface:

![Knowledge Base Connected](/images/kb-screenshots/knowledge-base-connected.png)

This interface provides:
- **Web Crawler**: Add content from websites
- **File Uploader**: Upload documents (PDF, Word, etc.)
- **File Importer**: Import files from various sources

### Configuration Options

After your knowledge base has data and is synced, additional options become available in the Configuration tab:

![Strict Mode and Keywords](/images/kb-screenshots/strict-mode-keywords.png)

#### Trigger Keywords (Optional)
- Add words or phrases that automatically trigger knowledge base searches
- Useful for domain-specific terms, product names, or technical jargon
- Only works when Strict Mode is disabled

#### Strict Mode (Optional)
- When enabled: Assistant only uses knowledge base information
- When disabled: Assistant can use both knowledge base and general knowledge
- Provides more control over response accuracy vs. flexibility

<Info>
Knowledge bases are essential for domain-specific assistants. They provide the information your assistant needs to give accurate, helpful responses.
</Info>

<Tip>
Start with a small, focused knowledge base and expand it over time based on user questions and needs.
</Tip>

## Tools Tab

Tools allow the agent to get up to date information from the apps you work in.

### Available Integrations

#### Atlassian (Jira & Confluence)
- Access Jira issues and Confluence pages with official Atlassian MCP server
- Connect button to enable integration

#### HubSpot
- CRM and marketing automation
- Connect button to enable integration

<Tip>
Connect tools to give your assistant access to real-time data from your business applications.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Model

- **GPT-4o**: Best for general-purpose assistants
- **GPT-5**: Excellent for complex reasoning and analysis
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Good for creative tasks and content generation

### 2. Configure Strict Mode Appropriately

- **Enable Strict Mode** when you want responses based only on your knowledge base
- **Disable Strict Mode** when you want the assistant to use general knowledge as well

### 3. Use Trigger Keywords Effectively

- Add domain-specific terms that should always trigger knowledge base searches
- Include product names, technical terms, and company-specific language

### 4. Write Clear Instructions

- Be specific about your assistant's role and limitations
- Include examples of good responses
- Set clear boundaries for what the assistant should and shouldn't do
