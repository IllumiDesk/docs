## Workspace

The workspace is your private environment for a ChatGPT/Claude desktop-like experience with your data. It provides a familiar chat interface where you can switch between assistants, upload files, connect to external tools, and control how deeply the AI thinks about your questions.

## Assistant Selector

### Switching Assistants

Use the assistant selector button to switch between different assistants:

<ParamField body="assistant_selector" type="dropdown">
Choose from your created assistants or the default "IllumiChat" assistant.
</ParamField>

<Tip>
Make sure to switch from the default assistant to the one you want to use for your specific task.
</Tip>

### Setting Default Assistant

You can change which assistant appears by default:

1. Go to the assistant's page
2. Click the star icon to make it your default assistant
3. The starred assistant will appear first in the selector

<Info>
The default "IllumiChat" assistant is available for users who haven't created their own assistants yet and want to test the workspace functionality.
</Info>

## Adding Files and Connections

### Plus Button

The plus button allows you to enhance your workspace with additional data and tools:

<ParamField body="plus_button" type="button">
Click to add files or manage MCP connections.
</ParamField>

### File Upload

Upload files directly to your workspace:

- **Supported formats**: PDF, Word documents, text files, images
- **File size limits**: Varies by plan
- **Processing**: Files are automatically processed and made available to your assistant

<Tip>
Upload relevant documents to give your assistant context for better responses.
</Tip>

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Connections

Connect to third-party tools using MCP:

#### Available Integrations

**Jira**
- Access project issues and workflows
- Query ticket information
- Update issue status

**HubSpot**
- Access CRM data and contacts
- Retrieve marketing information
- Manage customer relationships

<Info>
MCP connections provide real-time access to your business data, making your assistant more powerful and contextually aware.
</Info>

<Tip>
You can connect MCP tools directly from the workspace using the plus button. This is convenient when you're already working with your data and want to add new integrations on the fly. Just make sure you're on the correct assistant - you cannot connect MCP tools to the default IllumiChat assistant.
</Tip>

## Deep Research Mode

### Understanding Deep Research

The deep research button controls how thoroughly the AI thinks about your questions:

<ParamField body="deep_research" type="toggle">
Switch between normal and deep research modes.
</ParamField>

### When to Use Deep Research

**Normal Mode:**
- Quick responses
- General questions
- Simple tasks
- Lower credit usage

**Deep Research Mode:**
- Complex analysis
- Detailed explanations

<Warning>
Deep research mode uses significantly more credits than normal mode. Use it only when you need more thorough analysis.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Monitor your credit usage in the account settings to ensure you don't exceed your plan limits.
